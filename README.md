The AllScale Runtime System
===========================

The AllScale Runtime System is a thin layer on top of [HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx) to allow for a fully dynamic,
runtime adaptive execution of fine grained tasks for massive parallelism by the [AllScale Compiler](https://github.com/allscale/allscale_compiler).

It is part of the [AllScale](https://www.allscale.eu) environment.

This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 671603
