The Python files in this folder provide automatic regression tests for AllScale runtime/scheduler. It can use any AllScale benchmark and poplulate performance data, such as execution time, energy consumption, initial number of threads,  statistics of the number of threads after throttling (min, max, mean, standard deviation). In addition, benchmark related data, such as benchmark name, benchmark arguments, etc. are populated as well. All these information are kept in SQLite3 database and can be used to plot the benchmark results and save it in pdf files.
